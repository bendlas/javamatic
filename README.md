> Sir, I see that you're interested in adding a field to your class. Certainly, you are in the right office, let me get you an application form. Please fill it in in camel case. Yes, correct, apart from the messages section, remember to add spaces there. Oh I see there is an enumeration involved as well. All capital letters for that one I'm afraid. Are you done? Great, please sign here, here and here. I'll photocopy this and then you can take it up to the 3rd floor where you can get an application form for getters and setters. Sorry, I'm afraid the elevator is broken.
